# Hi there, I'm Stephan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student studying computer science and physics at [UCL](https://ucl.ac.uk). I'm passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and exploring the intersections between computer science and physics. 

There isn't anything much here as I prefer to do most of my work over on GitLab.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub though!
